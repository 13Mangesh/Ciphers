# Ciphers
Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic texts.
It is a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. 
The encryption of the plaintext is done using the Vigenère table.
The table consists of 26 rows and 26 columns and each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet.
The alphabet is chosen from one of the rows.
We have to generate a key from the inputted keyword of the same length as the length of inputted plaintext.
